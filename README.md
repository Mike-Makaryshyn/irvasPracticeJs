# irvasPracticeJs

First practical project from the Udemy course (Практический JavaScript (Продвинутый уровень)) by Ivan Petrychenko.

git i to install all the packages

Write gulp in console to launch a server and compile all the files and accomplish all the tasks. In case something went wrong, try to install gulp globally 

If you want to check POST requests you need to simulate apropriate server. I used open-server. Don't forget to change the directory in gulp file.
